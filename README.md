## Updated, tweaked, and (arguably) improved version of [ScrollScribe](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/86623/) (LE) / [ScrollScribe SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32439)
Has the following changes:
- No longer requires building a patch through SSEdit
- Hopefully improved detection of "garbage" spells so they won't show up as craftable options
- Now comes with a small tutorial/introduction "quest"
- Finally added that perk tree I promised six years ago, integrated into Custom Skills Menu
- (MCM) Option to use filled Soulgems for crafting purposes, because there's too many useless filled Petty Soulgems in my inventory
- (MCM) Option to only allow scribing spells you have learned (this is the default)
- Two new toys in the form of Scroll Extraction and Scroll Fusion abilities
  - Extraction allows turning Spell Tomes directly into their Scroll-ified version
  - Fusion does what the name suggests

**Important: Modifying your load order by adding or removing plugins will wipe all custom Scrolls from the game!**

This should not cause issues, but obviously means you will need to re-craft them.
