And a gem or two.\n<br />   Ever wanted to roleplay a Paladin? A Cleric or Monk? Maybe a Bard or another hybrid who enhances his combat skills with magic?\n<br />   No of course you didn't because magic is useless unless you dump a ton of stats into Magicka and perks into the spell schools.\n<br />   Scrolls are the obvious solution to this problem but obtaining them in decent quantities is impossible,\n<br />   let alone obtaining ones you actually NEED. This mod aims to solve this problem by adding proper scroll crafting into the game.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]   What? Yet ANOTHER \"scroll crafting\" mod? Nobody even uses these because scrolls suck.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />   Essentially yes. This mod allows you to craft spell scrolls. But what makes ScrollScribe different from the alternatives is the fact that it allows\n<br />   you to put\xa0\x45VERY\xa0spell on paper! And when I say EVERY, I do mean it.\n<br />   Spellscribe does not rely on pre-existing scrolls or manual conversion of hundreds of mod-added spells and creation of patches for every\n<br />   modpack (ain't nobody got time for that).\n<br />   Instead, we use the power of\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164/]SSEEdit[/url]\xfeff\xa0\xfeffscripts to create a patch that will\xa0\x63onvert any and all spells\xa0\x66rom our load order into a craftable scroll!\n<br />   If you aren't familiar with Tes5Edit scripts: Think SkyProc, but better.\n<br />\n<br />   Well, theoretically we could do that but in practice that would be a very bad idea, as the majority of \"spells\" aren't actual spells the player\xa0\n<br />   can learn through normal means, let alone cast them for a useful effect. To keep things from going crazy there are limitations.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />   [size=3]Spells that\xa0will\xa0\x62\x65 converted:[/size]\n<br />[size=2]   Every spell that can be learned through a Spell Book (yes concentration spells too!)\n<br />   Warning: Some mods add spell tomes that teach utility/debug spells (like AddItemMenu). If you don't want scroll version of those spells\n<br />   to show up you need to\xa0\x64isable those mods before generating your patch.\xa0\n<br />   Leaving them in won't do any harm but it's definitely gonna ruin your IMMERSION.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]   Spells that\xa0won't\xa0\x62\x65 converted:[/size]\n<br />   Everything that can't be learned through a Spell Book\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />   [size=4]The features (so far)[/size]\n<br />   [size=2]- creates craftable scrolls of\xa0\x61ll\xa0learnable spells[/size]\n<br />   [size=2]- adapts to your load order and is compatible with every spell package mod\xa0[/size]\n<br />   [size=2]-\xa0[s]crafting requires knowing the spell (this is to prevent funny interactions with some mod added spells)[/s]\n<br />   - simplified and user-friendly crafting system with the option to filter out unwanted scrolls from the menu[/size]\n<br />   [size=2]- master-level scrolls allow you to act while casting them when used from the left hand (it's a feature not a bug)\n<br />   - scrolls of concentration spells open up new gameplay options like allowing dual wielding characters to combat mages by using a Ward scroll\n<br />[/size]   - scrolls grow stronger with your Inscription experience which is gained through crafting\n<br />   - don't like the default balancing? adjust it to your liking in the MCM\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />   [s][size=4]Coming soon[/size]\n<br />   [size=2]- a minor perk/talent tree to allow for specialization\n<br />   - distribution into leveled lists so you can find all new scrolls out in the world[/size]\n<br />[/s]\n<br />\n<br />   [size=4]Crafting[/size]\n<br />   [size=2]Use Scroll Enchanter in Farengar's study (to be honest that one is just for decoration) or just use the Scroll Crafting power that you\n<br />   automagically get after installing and loading your game\n<br />\n<br />   All scrolls require just two ingredients:\n<br />   1 Roll of Paper\n<br />   x\xa0\x41rcane Dust\n<br />[/size]   \n<br />   What's Arcane Dust? It's a new item will automatically be extracted from\xa0\x65mpty\xa0Soul Gems in your inventory during the crafting process.\n<br />   Rolls of Paper will also be extracted from Burned and Ruined Books in the same way.\n<br />   This keeps crafting simple and removes the need for micromanaging Soul Gems and searching for Paper, which is surprisingly rare.\n<br />\n<br />   To avoid misunderstanding, here's how it works in detail: When you start crafting, all your empty gems will be turned to dust and books to paper\n<br />   at a ratio that you can adjust yourself. When you leave the crafting menu, all remaining Dust and Paper will be returned back as the Gem or Book\n<br />   it came from, assuming you have enough left to fully restore the item, otherwise you just get the leftover items. An illustration:\n<br />   [img]https://i.imgur.com/o4upGwP.png[/img]\n<br />   Smaller gems will be expended first so valuable Soul Gems will be preserved until you actually have to use their dust.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />   [size=4]Installation[/size]\n<br />   [size=2]Requires\xa0[url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE[/url]\xa0\x61nd\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863/?]SkyUI[/url][/size]\n<br />   [size=2]1. Download and extract mod into Data folder as per usual / use your mod manager[/size]\n<br />   [size=2]2. Download and extract/install Tes5Edit somewhere[/size]\n<br />   [size=2]3. Copy \"Edit Scripts\" folder from this mod into Tes5Edit's installation directory, overwrite if asked[/size]\n<br />   [size=2]4. Run Tes5Edit (if using MO, run it through MO) on your load order and wait until it's done loading (hold Shift on file selection to speed it up)[/size]\n<br />   [size=2]5. Right click on the left pane and select \"Apply Script\"[/size]\n<br />   [size=2]6. Select \"SCRIBE_GENERATE_SCROLLS\" from the drop-down and hit OK, then[/size]\xa0\x63hoose a name for the patch file\n<br />   [size=2]7. Wait for \"Learnable spells converted: x\" message and pray it doesn't throw an error[/size]\n<br />   [size=2]8. Close Tes5Edit and save changes to your generated patch[/size]\n<br />   [size=2]9. Activate the generated patch .esp\xa0!NOTHING WORKS WITHOUT THE PATCH![/size]\n<br />   10. Play\n<br />\n<br />   [size=4]Updating[/size]\n<br />   [size=2]Overwrite existing files with new version\n<br />   Generating a new patch isn't necessary unless explicitly stated in the file description.\n<br />   When generating a new patch, first delete the old one and choose the same name for your new patch.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />   [size=4]Uninstallation[/size]\n<br />   Remove installed files\n<br />\n<br />   This mod is safe to remove at any point. All that will happen is your crafted scrolls will disappear.\n<br />   There are no continuously running scripts. Orphaned scripts and script instances in your save file are harmless.\n<br />\n<br />   [size=4]Compatibility[/size]\n<br />   As of version 1.2 the mod uses the Actor Value \"Variable09\" and will be incompatible with any other mod that uses it (none known to me).\n<br />   Other than that this mod should be compatible with everything.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />   Closing comments\n<br />   [size=2]This is my first real attempt at a mod. Bugs and balance issues will crop up and I will attempt to fix them. The balancing will require user input.\n<br />   My ultimate goal with this is to improve the spell scroll system and give people who enjoy the concept (like myself) a better experience.\n<br />   Feedback encouraged.\n<br />[/size]   Thank you.[/center]"
